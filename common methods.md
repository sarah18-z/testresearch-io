| **Error Correction Codes (ECC)**  | Utilizes additional bits to detect and correct errors.                                                             | X      | X       | X      | X      |
| **Built-In Self-Test (BIST)**     | On-chip testing mechanisms that periodically test memory integrity.                                               | X      |         |        |        |
| **Parity Bits**                   | Adding parity bits to data to check for errors.                                                                    | X      |         |        |        |
| **Redundancy**                    | Using redundant circuits to take over in case of a fault.                                                          | X      |         |        |        |
| **Scrubbing**                     | Periodic reading and rewriting of memory to correct soft errors.                                                   | X      |         |        |        |
| **Wear Leveling**                 | Spreads write/erase cycles evenly across the memory to prevent premature wear-out of specific blocks.              |        | X       | X      | X      |
| **S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring**         | Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology helps in predicting failures by monitoring health and performance. |        | X       |        | X      |
| **Radiation Hardening**           | Incorporating design elements and materials that make the memory resistant to radiation effects.                   |        | X       |        |        |
| **Redundant Storage**             | Storing critical data in multiple locations to recover from corruption.                                            |        |         | X      |        |
| **Power Fail Safeguards**         | Implementing techniques like power loss detection circuits to manage write operations during power failures.       |        |         | X      |        |
| **Periodic Testing**              | Regularly reading and verifying the integrity of data stored in the flash memory.                                   |        |         | X      |        |
| **Bad Block Management (BBM)**    | Identifies and marks defective blocks to prevent their usage.                                                     |        |         |        | X      |
