### Radiation Testing: TID and SEE for DDR, NAND, eMMC, and SPI Memories

Radiation testing is crucial for evaluating the resilience of electronic components used in high-radiation environments, such as space or nuclear facilities. Two common types of tests are Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effect (SEE). Hereâ€™s an in-depth explanation of these tests as applied to DDR, NAND, eMMC, and SPI memories.

### Total Ionizing Dose (TID) Test

#### Objective
The TID test measures a component's resistance to cumulative ionizing radiation exposure, which can cause permanent degradation in electronic devices.

#### Procedure
1. **Exposure**: The component is exposed to a radiation source, often gamma rays from cobalt-60.
2. **Dosage**: Radiation dose is measured in rads (radiation absorbed dose), with typical test levels ranging from a few krad(Si) to several Mrad(Si).
3. **Electrical Parameter Measurement**: Electrical parameters (leakage current, threshold voltage, switching speed, etc.) are measured during and after exposure to detect degradation.
4. **Result Analysis**: The results help evaluate the component's tolerance to cumulative radiation dose and identify failure thresholds.

#### Effects on Memories
- **DDR**: Memory cells and support circuits can experience changes in leakage currents and threshold voltages, affecting data reliability.
- **NAND**: Data retention and read/write cycles may be compromised.
- **eMMC**: Degradation may manifest as read/write errors and decreased performance.
- **SPI**: Serial communication can be disrupted by changes in the electrical characteristics of the components.

### Single Event Effect (SEE) Test

#### Objective
The SEE test assesses a component's susceptibility to events caused by individual energetic particles (protons, neutrons, heavy ions) that can induce transient or permanent disruptions.

#### Types of SEE
- **Single Event Upset (SEU)**: Temporary bit flip.
- **Single Event Latch-up (SEL)**: Persistent unwanted conduction leading to overcurrent.
- **Single Event Burnout (SEB)**: Permanent damage caused by catastrophic failure.
- **Single Event Transient (SET)**: Unwanted transient pulse in a signal.

#### Procedure
1. **Exposure**: The component is exposed to a beam of energetic particles in a particle accelerator.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: During exposure, transient behaviors (bit flips, abnormal currents) are monitored.
3. **Post-Exposure Analysis**: Effects are analyzed to determine the nature and frequency of disruptions.

#### Effects on Memories
- **DDR**: SEUs can cause bit flips, while SELs can lead to excessive currents, potentially causing destruction.
- **NAND**: SEUs can cause read/write errors, and SELs can affect control circuits.
- **eMMC**: Susceptible to SEUs that can corrupt data and SELs that can damage memory management circuits.
- **SPI**: SETs can induce communication errors, and SEUs can corrupt configuration registers.
